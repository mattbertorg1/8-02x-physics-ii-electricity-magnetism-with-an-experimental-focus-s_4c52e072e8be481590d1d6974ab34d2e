Each partnership of two students will build and use 9 experiments. All experiments need to be demonstrated and checked off during lab hours. Experiment related questions will be included on the problem sets in the [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments) section, as well as in each of the 4 quizzes in the [exams]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/exams) section. Early check-off of the experiments will be awarded bonus points.

Complete instructions and questions for the experiments can be found in the experiment manual.Â All necessary materials can be acquired from an online electronics supply source.

For the lab write-ups (to be handed in by both partners, together with the problem sets), please follow the questions that are provided together with the problem sets and **not** the questions in the manual - those are similar, but often somewhat confusing.
